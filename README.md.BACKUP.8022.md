Reactive API for invoking MobileFirst Platform (MFP) procedures from an Android client. Support for auto-serialization of JSON responses is also provided in a reactive manner.

To connect to an MFP instance, simply call:

``` java
Observable<WLResponse> connect = CafeJava.connect(context);
connect.subscribe();
```

With MFP 7.0 came the introduction of Java adapters. We can create a `JavaProcedureInvoker` that will handle the request for a procedure invocation:

``` java
ProcedureInvoker invoker = new JavaProcedureInvoker.Builder("adapterName", "path/{path_param}")
        .pathParam("path_param", value)
        .queryParam("param_name", value)
        .httpMethod(HttpMethod.GET /* default is GET */)
        .build();
```

We can then pass our `ProcedureInvoker` instance to CafeJava to trigger an invocation:

``` java
Observable<WLResponse> invocation = CafeJava.invokeProcedure(invoker);
invocation.subscribe(); // invocation is performed per subscriber
```

If we have a JavaScript based adapter, we can use a `JSProcedureInvoker` object instead.

<<<<<<< HEAD
For any `WLResponse` containing a valid JSON payload, CafeJava can serialize it automatically for us:
=======
``` java
new CafeJava().invokeProcedure("adapter", "procedure", "arg1", "arg2", "arg3");
```

Request options, such as a timeout, can be specified on a `CafeJava` instance. This instance can then be shared across multiple procedure invocations:

``` java
CafeJava cafeJava = new CafeJava().setTimeout(5000);
cafeJava.invokeProcedure("adapter", "procedureOne");
cafeJava.invokeProcedure("adapter", "procedureTwo");
```

CafeJava also provides auto-serialization support for procedure invocations that return valid JSON. We can supply the `Class` literal of the type we want to serialize to and chain our `Observable<WLResponse>` with the compose operator:

``` json
{
  "name": "John Smith",
  "age": 42,
  "isDeveloper": true
}
```

``` java
Observable<Person> personObservable =
    observable.compose(CafeJava.serializeTo(Person.class));
```

For more complex responses where the desired data for serialization is nested, we can supply the list of member names that will obtain the serializable data:

``` json
{
  "result": {
    "person": {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "age": 42,
      "isDeveloper": true
    }
  }
}
```
>>>>>>> master

``` java
Observable<Person> person = invocation.compose(CafeJava.serializeTo(Person.class));
```

If we're expecting back an array of objects, we can alternatively supply a `TypeToken`:

``` java
TypeToken<List<Person>> token = new TypeToken<List<Person>>() {};
Observable<List<Person>> people = invocation.compose(CafeJava.serializeTo(token));
```

## Installation

In your app's `build.gradle` file:

``` gradle
compile 'com.ibm.mil:cafejava:1.0.0'
```

In the same file, add the following `packagingOptions` to the `android` closure:

``` gradle
android {
    ...
    packagingOptions {
        pickFirst 'META-INF/ASL2.0'
        pickFirst 'META-INF/LICENSE'
        pickFirst 'META-INF/NOTICE'
    }
}
```

The `wlclient.properties` file generated with your MFP project also needs to be added to your app's `assets` folder.
