# CafeJava

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IBM-MIL/CafeJava.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IBM-MIL/CafeJava)

Reactive API for invoking [MobileFirst Platform](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/mobilefirstplatform) (MFP) procedures from an Android client.

To connect to an MFP instance, simply call:

``` java
Observable<WLResponse> connect = CafeJava.connect(context);
connect.subscribe();
```

With MFP 7.0 came the introduction of Java adapters. We can create a `JavaProcedureInvoker` that will handle the request for a procedure invocation:

``` java
ProcedureInvoker invoker = new JavaProcedureInvoker.Builder("adapterName", "path/{path_param}")
        .pathParam("path_param", value)
        .queryParam("param_name", value)
        .httpMethod(HttpMethod.GET /* default is GET */)
        .build();
```

We can then pass our `ProcedureInvoker` instance to CafeJava to trigger an invocation:

``` java
Observable<WLResponse> invocation = CafeJava.invokeProcedure(invoker);
invocation.subscribe(); // invocation is performed per subscriber
```

If we have a JavaScript based adapter, we can use a `JSProcedureInvoker` object instead.

For any `WLResponse` containing a valid JSON payload, CafeJava provides a custom operator that can do the conversion for us:

``` java
Observable<Person> person = invocation.lift(new JsonConverter<>(Person.class));
```

If we're expecting back an array of objects, we can alternatively supply a `TypeReference<T>` to `JsonConverter`:

``` java
TypeReference<List<Person>> reference = new TypeReference<List<Person>>() {};
Observable<List<Person>> people = invocation.lift(new JsonConverter<>(reference));
```

## Installation
In your app's `build.gradle` file:

``` gradle
compile 'com.ibm.mil:cafejava:2.1.0'
```

The `wlclient.properties` file generated with your MFP project needs to be added to your app's `assets` folder.

CafeJava requires a **minimum SDK version of 9** or above.
