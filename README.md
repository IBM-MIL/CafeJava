# CafeJava

Reactive API for invoking MFP procedures from an Android client. Support for auto-serialization of JSON responses is also provided in a reactive manner.

Connecting to an MFP instance from an `Activity` is as simple as:

``` java
new CafeJava().connect(this)
              .subscribe(new Action1<WLResponse>() {
                  @Override public void call(WLResponse wlResponse) {
                      // onSuccess
                  }
              }, new Action1<Throwable>() {
                  @Override public void call(Throwable throwable) {
                      // onFailure
                  }
              });
```

Invoking a procedure for a given adapter is done in similar fashion:

``` java
new CafeJava().invokeProcedure("adapter", "procedure")
              .subscribe(new Action1<WLResponse>() {
                  @Override public void call(WLResponse wlResponse) {
                      // onSuccess
                  }
              }, new Action1<Throwable>() {
                  @Override public void call(Throwable throwable) {
                      // onFailure
                  }
              });
```

We can use [retrolambda](https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda) to reduce the clunky syntax of anonymous classes:

``` java
new CafeJava().invokeProcedure("adapter", "procedure")
              .subscribe(response -> {}, throwable -> {});
```

Furthermore, we can easily provide the necessary parameters for a procedure invocation:

``` java
new CafeJava().invokeProcedure("adapter", "procedure", "arg1", "arg2", "arg3");
```

Request options, such as a timeout, can be specified on a `CafeJava` instance. This instance can then be shared across multiple procedure invocations:

``` java
CafeJava cafeJava = new CafeJava.setTimeout(5000);
cafeJava.invokeProcedure("adapter", "procedureOne");
cafeJava.invokeProcedure("adapter", "procedureTwo");
```

CafeJava also provides auto-serialization support for procedure invocations that return valid JSON. We can supply the `Class` object of the type we want to serialize to and chain our `Observable<WLResponse>` with the compose operator:

``` java
Observable<Person> personObservable =
    observable.compose(CafeJava.serializeTo(Person.class));
```

For more complex responses where the desired data for serialization is nested, we can supply the list of member names that will obtain the serializable data:

``` java
observable.compose(CafeJava.serializeTo(Person.class, "result", "person"));
```

If the response returns an array, we can use `TypeToken` from the Gson library to help us:

``` java
TypeToken<List<Person>> typeToken = new TypeToken<List<Person>>(){};
Observable<List<Person>> peopleObservable =
    observable.compose(CafeJava.serializeTo(typeToken, "result"));
```

## Running the sample app
We will use the [MFP CLI](https://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/install/#clui) to deploy the MFP sample project to our localhost.

From the `/cafejava-sample/MFPSampleProject` directory, issue the following command:
```
mfp start
```
Once the MFP server has successfully started, we can deploy the adapters to our local instance:
```
mfp deploy
```
We can verify that our local instance is working properly by invoking one of the sample procedures:
```
mfp adapter call SampleAdapter/getPersonFlat
```
This should return the following response:
```
{
  "isDeveloper": true,
  "isSuccessful": true,
  "age": 22,
  "name": "FirstName LastName"
}
```
In order for the Android sample app to connect to our local instance, we need to update wlclient.properties (found under the sample project's assets folder) by changing the value of the `wlServerHost` key to our machine's IP address.

Note: A new wlclient.properties file gets generated under `/cafejava-sample/MFPSampleProject/apps/SampleAndroidFramework` each time you deploy the adapter. This file can simply replace the one found in the sample project's assets folder.

## Download

For now, clone the project and add the `:cafejava` module as a library dependency to your project. We will soon upload an AAR to jcenter for easy gradle support.
